    "# Exercise: Train and Run Your First Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned that models are computer code that processes information to make a prediction or a decision. Here, we train a model to guess a comfortable boot size for a dog, based on the size of the harness that fits them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, there's no need to edit any code. Try to read it, understand it, then press the run button to run it. As always with these notebooks, it's vitally important that these code blocks are run in the correct order, and nothing is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you've never used the Jupyter Notebooks environment before, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others contain code.\n",
    "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. The **&#9658; Run** button will show up when you hover over the cell.\n",
    "> - The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "> - Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do with a model is load data. We cover this in more detail in a later exercise. For now, we just write our data directly in our code. Review and run the following code to get started:\n"

    "The objective is what we want the model to be able to do. For example, the objective of our scenario is to be able to estimate a dog’s boot size based on their harness size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a computer to understand our objective, we need to provide our goal as a code snippet called an objective function (also known as a cost function). Objective functions judge whether the model is doing a good job (estimating boot size well) or bad job (estimating boot size badly). We cover objective functions in more depth in later learning material.\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "Data refers to the information that we provide to the model (also known as inputs). In our scenario, the input is harness size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data also refers to information that the objective function might need. For example, if our objective function reports whether the model guessed the boot size correctly, it needs to know the correct boot size! For this reason, in our previous exercise, we provided both harness sizes and the correct answers to the training code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll practice working with data in the next exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The optimizer\n",
    "During training, the model makes a prediction, and the objective function calculates how well it performed. The optimizer is code that then changes the model’s parameters so the model will do a better job next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "How an optimizer adjusts the parameters is complex, and something we cover in later material. Don’t be intimidated, though; we don’t normally write our own optimizers, we use open-source frameworks where the hard work has been done for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that the objective, data, and optimizer are simply a means to train the model. They aren't needed once training is complete. It's also important to remember that training only changes the parameter values inside of a model; it doesn't change what kind of model is used."
